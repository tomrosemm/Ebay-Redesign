TODO: (XJ) Moving graph code from data_testing to index.html
TODO:(XS M) Input validation/cleaning
TODO:(S M) See if we can eliminate tasks own name from list of predecessors/successors available to it - maybe a separate function that checks current table row and deletes any matches being populated to it that have the same name as the current task name. If we shove that in the end of the update predecessors successors would that work?
TODO:(XM) Boundary times calculating and displaying to table
TODO:(XT - Keep adding quick usage info as needed) Quick Info in some form on main page, try as a div canvas or card type element on upper right of screen above graph in line with title. Contain quick usage tips for multiple menus and graph viewer, etc
TODO:(XT J) Populate cards on help page with different topics
TODO:(XJ) Make relevant info appear on graph with function tied to toggle triggers for on and off (Potentially remove from scope to make deadline?)
TODO:(XT) Replace sample picture for toggle info (currently the green circle)
TODO:(XT) Delete button fill space better
TODO:(XJ) Calculate critical path - Done
TODO:(XT) Remove testing pages links
TODO: (If time allows) Start script with calculate button disabled to not allow blank erroneous input
TODO:(XT) Disable or time spinner
TODO: Check for documentation needs everywhere
